# PunishmentGUIRecode
**Overview**

Welcome to the recoded version of PunishmentGUI! This source is mainly a menu system which has a premade config to turn it into a PunishmentGUI. 
This menu system is in use on [FateHubCore](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/9350/) and other BGHDDevelopment paid plugins so this is released under a diffrent license then the rest of our projects.

**Issue Reporting/Support**

While you may report issues via the "Issues" tab I recommend putting them on our [Discord](https://bghddevelopment.com/discord) as it will be a faster response.

**Suggestions**

We do have a suggestions and feedback site [here](https://feedback.bghddevelopment.com) which is reviewed by project maintainers, but feel free to make a pull request to add cool features without posting there!

**License**

Please view the [LICENSE](https://github.com/BGHDDevelopment/PunishmentGUIRecode/blob/master/LICENSE) file for more information on the license of this source code.
